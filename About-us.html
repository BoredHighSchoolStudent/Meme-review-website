					So the team of memes consists out of me*, Ellen and Pewdiepie. So the Pewdiepie thing might be a bit false since he isn't aware of his cooperation, but we're happy to steal his videos for our own good. This page will inform you on us, the meme dream team. You'll be able to read our short meme biographies and some other interesting stuff like our favorite memes!

						So... How to get started? Let's just start when I saw my first meme. It was a hot summer day, but with a nice cool brieze. So the weather was perfect and I was in my natural habitat: inside. Behind my mom's laptop I was browsing the interwebs when I came across a website named 'Youtube'. I clicked on the link and watched a few videos, but soon disaster would strike.
						The impending doom was a vine video. I clicked on it because of the flashy thumbnail and then, I saw it: a meme. It was a man holding up a paper with a Spongebob meme printed on it. I literally died laughing at it. I said I was wheezing in the comments. I did all I could to make clear that it was hilarious, like a normie. Vines made me a normie, but I soon grew up and got rid of my sickness. 
						My favorite meme as of now would be Sans memes.
