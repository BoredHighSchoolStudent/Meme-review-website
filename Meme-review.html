						<H2> -MEME REVIEW LIGHT- ALL NECCS MATTER! </H2>
						<div style="font:15px arial, sans-serif;
									font-style: italic;">
							<p> 
								This is a meme review light! In a meme review light, we do exaclty the same as normal but without the bullshit and we just get straight to the point!
							</p>	
						</div>
					
							<p> 
								So let's get started! The wide necc meme is sort off funny I guess and it certainly has the mystery meme factor included, but I'm not sure. Pewd's gave this a "This is so wholesome" and as a final verdict an "All neccs matter". Of course we can't disagree since he is El Presidente, but that aside this is a good meme. To conclude: so wholesome, 6/10, would necc again.

						<H4> This seems bad, but is it really that bad or is there something good to this? </H2>
						<p> 
							No, It's bad in every single way. It's trash, pure trash. It's extremely bad. It's so bad that I can't explain how bad it is with words. 
						</P>
						<H4>Can we just get this over with? </H4>
						<p> 
							Hopefully, Pewd's gave this meme a "Don't think it, don't say it." and we completely agree.

								UNDERTALE HAS RETURNED, though not under the name 'Undertale'. 'Deltarune' is the sequel to 'Undertale' and with this new found life in this series, the memes have followeed. This week we'll be reviewing the new meme kid in town: Sans memes! 
							</P>
							<H4> So... what's the joke? </H4>
							<p> 
								The joke is very simple, it's the Sans' theme song (you can listen to it on the soundcloud link on the right! So the joke is the song that appears pretty much everywhere you go on the internet. Watching Noisestorm's Crab Rave? Well at the drop the song's melody changes into Sans' theme song's one. 
								There's one problem, this meme isn't really applicable for all circumstances. And yes, this song is great and captures the fun of playing Toby Fox's 'Undertale' and 'Deltarune'. So enjoy the song just a few more times before it gets boring and let's move on. 
							</P>
							<H4> Conclusion time! </H4>
							<p> 
								Sans memes haven't been reviewed by Pewd's just yet, but he'll probably get to them soon enough. So what do we give Sans memes? I give it a 5, Pewd's is still working on giving it a rating -or at least we think he is-.

						<H2> This meme-review is all about Bongo Cat!</H2>
						<H4> The tale of a short lived meme </H4>
						<p>  
							The bongo cat meme is all about musical cats, it is a meme with endless possibilities. The meme unfortunately had a quick death because of the rise of the moth memes, which still mindblows me every single day.
							The moth meme is in my opinion less of a meme in comparison to Bongo Cat, mostly because the endless creative possibilities of bongo cat, just weren't there with the moth  memes.

						<div style="font:15px arial, sans-serif;
									font-style: italic;">
							<p> 
								As you might have noticed my colleague Pewdiepie is very fond of the Bongo Cat meme as well. I must also recommend you, of course, watch the full video.
							</p>
						</div>
							<H4> Short lived maybe, but was it any good while it was still alive? </h4>
							<p> 
								In my opinion, yes. The meme combinations that were made and never knowing what the end would lead to made the bong cat one of the best memes of september. Unfortunately it got overshadowed by the pure stupidity of the moth memes.
								In a way moth memes weren't supposed to be able to overtake bongo cat in popularity, not even by a long shot. Bongo cat is the perfect meme on paper, while the moth meme isn't at all. The weird thing is that I can't name what is bad about the moth meme
								it's just bad. I guess that we're missing a factor in our way of predicting rises in meme popularity, the mystery meme factor, the thing that makes memes populair while nobody understands the joke. I think that is what bongo cat was missing, but what the moth meme had. 
							</p>
							<H4> Conclusion time </H4>
							<p> 
								Bongo cat gets a 4 from Pewd's, but personally I'd give Bongo cat a 7. So the average is a 5,5 which is barely a pass, but good enough. *Claps twice* Meme review.

						<h4>Crab rave</h4>
							<p>
								this weeks meme review was about "crab song". This is actually an older meme but our colleague 
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> 
								Pewds
									</a>
								has only reviewed it recently, we're very sorry for the delay. Before reading the article we would highly recommend listening to the song for context.

							<p> 
								The 'crab rave' meme has the perfect ratio of sadness and happiness, while listening to this meme its actually impossible to feel anything since the all emotions cancel each other out. "this song is the perfect mash up of happiness and sadness, there is really no other way to put it. It's the alpha and the omega." -the holy master Pewds the first. <!--ittalic?-->
							</p>
							<br>
							
							<p>
								This is quite an unusual meme, it gained it popularity threw remixes like these two:

								and 		
									<FONT color="#4CAF50"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgf775OK1ug" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">
										COD WWII Gun Sync #5 - Crab Rave
									</a></FONT>
								witch both gained over 20.000 views.
